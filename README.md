Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I like to build software quickly and go down rabbit holes of computer science theory. Check out some of these examples:
- Computer Networking: Browser Fingerprinting (WIP), Peer-To-Peer Networks ([DropNow](https://dropnow.elguindi.xyz)), VPNs ([Bypassing VPN Restrictions](https://github.com/HusseinElguindi/udp-obfs-rs))
- Compilers: Recursive Descent, CFGs, DFAs ([LaTeX Transpiler](https://github.com/HusseinElguindi/xet))
- Concurrency: Green Threads, Task Schedulers ([Chunked File Downloader](https://github.com/HusseinElguindi/mtd))
- LLMs: RAG, Semantic Search (@ Camphor 2024)
- Data and ETL pipelines (@ Camphor 2024)
- Distributed Systems (@ Dropbase 2023, @ Camphor 2024)
- Concurrent Web Scraping (@ Camphor 2024, [Scraping an Interplanetary File System](https://github.com/youssefsoli/IPFE))
- Evolutionary Algorithms ([Steering Evolution](https://github.com/HusseinElguindi/steering-evolution))
